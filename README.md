# bloom filter cascade

Project from algorithm and datastructures 3 of 3rd bachelor computer science.
A cascade of [bloom filters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter) is used to categorize elements.

I got a 3.5/4 for this, pretty good :)

You can find my report in dutch in extra/verslag.pdf
